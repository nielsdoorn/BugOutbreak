# BugOutbreak
Can you contain the outbreak before it's too late?

Overview:
BugOutbreak is an immersive, educational game designed to teach the principles of software testing in an engaging and interactive way. Players take on the role of expert software testers trying to contain a rapidly spreading outbreak of bugs within a software system. Combining elements of exploration, strategy, and problem-solving, the game challenges players to apply real-world testing techniques while adapting to evolving scenarios.

Game Concept:
In BugOutbreak, bugs are spreading through a complex software environment, threatening to cause failures and disruptions. Players must act quickly to identify, contain, and eliminate the bugs before they cause widespread failures. As players navigate through different levels, they encounter various types of bugs—some hidden, others spreading rapidly—that require different testing strategies to resolve.

The game uses gamified elements and real-world software testing principles to enhance learning, such as exploratory testing, risk-based testing, and regression testing. Socratic questioning is integrated to prompt deeper thinking about testing methods and strategies.
